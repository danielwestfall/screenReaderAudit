Screen Reader User Interactive Form for Accessibility Auditing

This is a resource I'm pulling together for native screen reader users to audit existing web products. This is still in the early phases of work and if you're interested please feel free to reach out and we can work together on this. The code is currently very rough, but instead of using a modern frame work I wanted a simple html file for a user to download if they wanted and could edit easily with just basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS knowledge and tailor it to their needs. That may change in the future, so stay tuned!
